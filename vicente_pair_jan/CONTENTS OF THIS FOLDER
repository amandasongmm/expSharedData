 * Introduction
This folder contains the pairwise experiment data conducted in January 30- Feb 1, 2016.
- pairwise_fulldata.db is the raw database file storing the original experiment data. 
- parser_for_pair_data.py can parse the data and store it into the /experiment_data folder. 
- faceKey.pem is the key to connect to the ec2 server
- README_PARSER.txt explains the data structure of the doublet.csv data. 
- list_of_face_images.txt stores the mapping from Chicago dataset's original image names to new image names. 

 * Doublet Data format:
Column 1: worker counter (indicate the sequence of the worker taking the experiment)
Column 2: assignment ID
Column 3: worker ID
Column 4: hit ID
Column 5: trial type
	    0   instruction 
	    1   practice
	    2   actual trial
	    3   catchy question
Column 6: set number
Column 7: react_time (in ms)
Column 8: similarity score
	  for catchy question:
	  	true   means the subject provides the correct answer
		false   otherwise
	  for actual trial question:
		1   maximally dissimilar
		9   maximally similar
Column 9 & 10: two stimuli (image index)


* Basic experiment setting. 
Each set contains (0) instruction, (1) practice (2) actual trials (3) catchy questions. 
(0) and (1) are the same for everyone. 
(2) contains 100 pairs of different images repeating twice so there are 200 actual trials.
(3) 2 catchy questions is randomly drawn from (2). 

The experiment set sequence is stored at: 
https://github.com/amandasongmm/filesPublic/tree/master/vicente_pair_jan

The experiment images is stored at:
http://52.24.142.90/images/img/
It's from the Chicago dataset. 

The mapping from the original image name to the new name can be found in the same folder:
